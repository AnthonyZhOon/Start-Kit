# Start-Kit





## Pybinding usage

To write your MAPF planner using Python, you will need to implement your algorithm within the pyMAPFPlanner.py file. In order to use your pyMAPFPlanner with the starter kit, you must set USE_PYBINDING to true in the CMakeLists.txt and then compile it. An example of this process can be found in the test.cpp file within the Python directory.
