# Start-Kit





## Pybinding usage

If you want to write your MAPF planner in python, you need to implement your algorithm inside python/pyMAPFPlanner.py.

To use your pyMAPFPlanner along with the start kit, you need to set USE_PYBINDING to true in the CMakeLists.txt and compile. An example can be found in python/test.cpp
