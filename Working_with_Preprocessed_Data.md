Some algorithms have an offline preprocessing step to compute auxiliary data. The precomputed data is then loaded and made available to improve the perfromance of online planning. 
Examples of auxiliary data include machine learning models (weights), strong bounding heuristics and sophisticated constraints that prune the search space.
In this document we explain how to work with such auxiliary data if your submission makes use of it.

## Generate auxiliary data

The creation of auxiliary data is the responsbility of each participant. We assume you have external programs which can read and analyse problem instances. These programs may 

## Prepare for search
